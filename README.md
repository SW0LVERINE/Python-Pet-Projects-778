# Python-Pet-Projects-778
Small projects I have written to sharpen my technical skills.

The majority of these projects have been taken from programming books. Specifically, "Automate The Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart, 
and "Impractical Python Projects" by Lee Vaughan.

That being said, I hand typed the scripts from the book to further grasp the concepts.
